    Self-Exciting Threshold Autoregressive Model

    Parameters
    ----------
    endog : array-like
        The endogenous variable.
    order : integer
        The order of the SETAR model, indication the number of regimes.
    ar_order : integer
        The order of the autoregressive parameters.
    delay : integer, optional
        The delay for the self-exciting threshold variable.
    thresholds : iterable, optional
        The threshold values separating the data into regimes.
    min_regime_frac : scalar, optional
        The minumum fraction of observations in each regime.
    max_delay : integer, optional
        The maximum delay parameter to consider if a grid search is used. If
        left blank, it is set to be the ar_order.
    threshold_grid_size : integer, optional
        The number of elements in the threshold grid if a grid search is used.
